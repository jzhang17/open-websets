# üåç Meetups, Events, and Hackathons

One of our favorite things about working in AI is how much enthusiasm there is for building together. We want to help make that as easy and impactful for you as possible!

* **Find a meetup, hackathon, or webinar:** you can find the one for you on on our [global events calendar](https://mirror-feeling-d80.notion.site/0bc81da76a184297b86ca8fc782ee9a3?v=0d80342540df465396546976a50cfb3f).  
   * **Submit an event to our calendar:** email us at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef8a998a819b9caf838e81888c878e8681c18b8a99) with a link to your event page! We can also help you spread the word with our local communities.
* **Host a meetup:** If you want to bring a group of builders together, we want to help! We can publicize your event on our event calendar/Twitter, share with our local communities in Discord, send swag, or potentially hook you up with a sponsor. Email us at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c7a2b1a2a9b3b487aba6a9a0a4afa6aea9e9a3a2b1) to tell us about your event!
* **Become a meetup sponsor:** we often hear from groups of builders that want to get together, but are blocked or limited on some dimension (space to host, budget for snacks, prizes to distribute, etc.). If you'd like to help, send us an email to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8e9d8e859f98ab878a858c88838a8285c58f8e9d) we can share more about how it works!
* **Speak at an event:** meetup hosts are always looking for great speakers, presenters, and panelists. If you'd like to do that at an event, send us an email to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#543c3138383b1438353a33373c353d3a7a303122) with more information about yourself, what you want to talk about, and what city you're based in and we'll try to match you with an upcoming event!
* **Tell us about your LLM community:** If you host or participate in a community that would welcome support from LangChain and/or our team, send us an email at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dcd1d8d8dbf4d8d5dad3d7dcd5ddda9ad0d1c2) and let us know how we can help.

E-mail [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#96fef3fafaf9d6faf7f8f1f5fef7fff8b8f2f3e0) with a draft of your post! Or even an idea for something you want to write about.
* **Get your product onto our [integrations hub](https://integrations.langchain.com/):** Many developers take advantage of our seamless integrations with other products, and come to our integrations hub to find out who those are. If you want to get your product up there, tell us about it (and how it works with LangChain) at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1c9c4cdcdcee1cdc0cfc6c2c9c0c8cf8fc5c4d7).
