Find a Contractor\n\n**Find**a Contractor\n====================\n\nSelecting a qualified electrical contractor for your home or business can be challenging. You know something is wrong, but you lack the expertise to diagnose the problem yourself – and you are at the mercy of the supposed expert. Most electrical contractors are specialists to one degree or another, so it helps to identify your particular needs before you start calling.\n\n### [Login for more options.](https://www.necanet.org/login?ReturnUrl=https%3a%2f%2fwww.necanet.org%2fabout-neca%2fdirectories%2ffind-a-contractor)\n\nZIP Code Federal ID Chapter Division \n\nCountry State City \n\nX\n\nZIP Code \n\nX\n\nSpecialties \n\n*   -

However, information suggests it is part of a larger company (Centuri) and there's a mention of an ESOP, so it might not be founder-led or have a non-ESOP structure.\n*   **PowerGrid Services:** Revenue is reported around $178 million, meeting the revenue criteria. While there are mentions of the owners and management having long experience and a CEO/Owner is listed, there is also news of an upcoming acquisition, which would likely impact its founder-led status and ownership structure.\n*   **Bunney's Inc.:** Revenue is reported around $32.4 million, which is close to the $40 million threshold but not definitively over. Their website states they are a family/woman-owned organization, suggesting it could be founder-led. However, search results indicate it is an ESOP company, which does not meet the non-ESOP criteria.\n*   **Rural Electric Inc.:** Revenue is reported to be around $37.1 million, close to the $40 million threshold but not definitively over. Search results explicitly state that Rural Electric Inc. is an ESOP company, which does not meet the non-ESOP criteria.\n\nThe other companies found in the initial searches appear to have revenues significantly below the $40 million requirement.","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{},"tool_call_chunks":[],"id":"run-edc3714f-d33f-4c68-8400-256164037d71","tool_calls":[],"invalid_tool_calls":[]}}],"entities":[{"name":"Energized Substation Maintenance","url":"https://esminc.info/"},{"name":"Active Station Maintenance","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/active-station-maintenance"},{"name":"Tony Demaria Electric, Inc.
