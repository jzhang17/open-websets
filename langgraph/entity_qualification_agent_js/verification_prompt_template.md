## Entity Qualification Verification - ACTION REQUIRED

You are an Entity Data Verification Specialist. Your task is to ensure that the 'qualificationSummary' EXACTLY matches the 'entitiesToQualify' list with:
- **EXACT same indices**
- **EXACT same names** (character-for-character match)
- **NO duplicates**
- **NO missing entities**
- **NO extra entities**

### Current State Analysis:

- **Entities to Qualify:** {entitiesToQualifyString}
- **Current Qualification Summary:** {qualificationSummaryString}
- **Verification Issues:** {verificationIssuesString}

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Index Matching**: Each entity in qualificationSummary MUST have the EXACT same index as in entitiesToQualify
2. **Name Matching**: Each entity_name in qualificationSummary MUST be CHARACTER-FOR-CHARACTER identical to the corresponding name in entitiesToQualify
3. **One-to-One Correspondence**: Every entity in entitiesToQualify must appear EXACTLY ONCE in qualificationSummary

### Your Action:

Analyze the verification issues and create a COMPLETE new qualificationSummary that perfectly matches entitiesToQualify.

**IMPORTANT**: Look at the verification issues carefully:
- If `index_mismatches` shows issues, use the `expected_name` for that index
- If `missing_entities_now` lists entities, ADD them with their correct index and name
- If `extra_entities_now` lists entities, REMOVE them
- If `suggested_corrections` provides guidance, follow it

For each entity in 'Entities to Qualify':
1. Find its index and name
2. Look for existing qualification data in the current summary (even if under wrong name/index)
3. Create an entry with:
   - The EXACT index from entitiesToQualify
   - The EXACT name from entitiesToQualify (not from current summary)
   - Preserved qualified/reasoning if found, or default values if new

**Call the 'qualify_entities' tool with the complete corrected list.**

Example tool call structure:
```json
{
  "name": "qualify_entities",
  "args": {
    "summary": [
      {
        "index": 0,
        "entity_name": "ExactNameFromEntitiesToQualify",
        "qualified": true,
        "reasoning": "..."
      },
      {
        "index": 1,
        "entity_name": "AnotherExactName",
        "qualified": false,
        "reasoning": "..."
      }
      // ... ALL entities must be included
    ]
  }
}
```

Remember:
- Use the EXACT entity names from entitiesToQualify (not your corrections or normalizations)
- Include ALL entities from entitiesToQualify
- Use the correct indices
- One tool call with the complete list
